# sharedbaseline

experimenting in implementing the 'shared baseline' dependency management strategy using renv tools

Goal: host {renv} lockfiles here which could then be used for the 'shared baseline' strategy described here: https://environments.rstudio.com/shared.html

Inspiration: {renv}, {capsule}, {switchr}

Caveat: Learning as I go.
